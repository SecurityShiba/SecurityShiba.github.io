If you are already interested in the Cyber Security field and want to make a start, you have come to the right place! Keep in mind that i'm approaching this from the perspective of a penetration tester. This post will help you if you are a student or wanting to make a career change into cyber security, and are ready to do the ground work to get your foot in the door.

## Disclaimer

### *Don't ever use hacking techniques for personal gain*
* Never hack systems without explicit written permission, and even then think carefully about whether what you are targeting is appropriate. During an internship early in my career, I was offered the opportunity to "poke around within the company system(s) to see what I could find". With the knowledge I have now, I am thankful that I refused. Even an experienced penetration tester can easily bring down a company's IT systems. If a system goes down you could be liable for damages, or depending on the system, put lives at risk.
* **There are many extremely talented hackers who are in jail, which is a waste of their talent. Hacking for malicious intent, or for personal gain, means that no company can trust you enough to hire you. Trust is fundamental to the security team and the services they provide - break this trust and you will never work in the security industry again.**

## Real Talk

Many people who work in cyber security come from unique and different careers or backgrounds. Some start as developers, sysadmins or network technicians. Others come from hospitality, government and even from the army. Some of the best people I know in the field *don't even have a university degree*. Not everyone takes the standard path when entering a field, and cyber security is no exception. The one thing that they all have in common is hardwork and tenacity - they didn't give up to pursue what they loved. You can also make your passion a relatity, and have fun getting there. This post aims to give you a head start.

There is some pre-requisquite knowledge required before you will be ready to apply for a job. However how you acquire this knowledge is up to you. You can study an Information Technology (IT) degree, you can gain experience by working an IT job or you can also do self study without going to university, while working. If you are working in a field that isn't related to IT or security don't dismay. Personally I worked my way through the ranks in the hospitality industry before I could finally land my first IT helpdesk role.

Don't get hung up on trying to know all concepts right away. You don't need to be a walking encyclopedia, but you do need to know the basics. Combine this with a passion for learning, problem solving and the tenacity to try harder and you will go far in this field.

### First you get da monies

Your objective is to land a cyber security job. To do this, most potential employers want to see two things: that you are passionate, and that you have something to show for it. Whether its at a meetup event or job interview, when you talk to them, they are sizing you up thinking:
* Is this person a good investment?
* Does this person want to be challenged?
* What is their current knowledge or skill level?
* Can they talk to clients?

It's all great to say you love cyber and CTFsâ€¦ but if you haven't competed in any or have write ups to show for it, you aren't backing that up with evidence.

## Game plan

I'm going to lay out my strategy that will give you a competitive advantage over your peers who are also trying to get their foot in the door. Following this strategy also gives you more negotiating power, as you will be able to demonstrate that you have a strong personal brand, good skills and a passion that will translate into high quality work for your employer.

These are the four key areas:

* Cyber Security Knowledge
* Your Portfolio
* Social Media Presence
* Community Involvement


## Basic Cyber Security Knowledge

**The CIA triad**

> *Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.*

Understanding the CIA triad is key to relating your super awesome SQL injection finding, into something useful for the client to apply to their business.

**People**

People are a part of the system. They are also the #1 security weakness in any organisation and your #1 customer. They pay for you to test their systems and provide guidance on how they can improve their security posture. The main point to remember is that you are going to use your professional skills and knowledge to indentify their wekanesses, and then communicate this to them in a way that is easy for them to understand. When you write a report and you have moved on to other work, they should still be able to read it and understand:
* What their weaknesses are
* Why they should care about them, and
* What they can do to fix it.

Just remember, at the end of the day, your advice isn't law - they may take on your suggested fixes, or they may not. Don't take it personally. Every company has a different situation, so have an open mind.

**Learning Resources**

Currently the University of NSW offers a *free* course in cyber security as a part of the 'Security Engineering' program. The University of NSW is extremely well known for producing highly skilled cyber graduates, so go get some of that sweet, sweet knowledge.

* https://www.openlearning.com/courses/sec

Hacker highschool also has some great materials that covers the basic core concepts and technologies. Don't be afraid to brush up if you need to, getting comfortable with the basics is key.

* http://www.hackerhighschool.org/lessons.html

**OWASP Top Ten**

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a major resource for pentesters. It uses results from thousands of web application tests to author the "OWASP Top 10" which lists the top 10 most common web application vulnerabilities.

Study it, and explore the other resources OWASP has to offer.

**Vulnerable VMs**

Armed with your new found OWASP knowledge, it is best to have a crack at a practice VM. Having hands on experience exploiting these vulnerabilities not only makes it easier to understand, but you will be able to provide examples in your job interview.

#### Networking:

> 100-101 Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 (ICND1) is the exam associated with the CCENT certification and a tangible first step in achieving the CCNA Routing and Switching certification.

* http://www.freeccnastudyguide.com/study-guides/icnd1-100-101/

#### Programming & Scripting:

* Check out the free courses avalible on [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to teach yourself the programming basics. 
* Windows batch scripting
* Windows powershell
* get to know your way around the commandline terminal
* Linux bash scripting
* That site that explains linux commands [this awesome site](http://explainshell.com/)

## Your Portfolio

Your portfolio should aim to showcase your technical knowledge and experience. This is what you bring to the table during the interview. At a minimum, you should aim to have one of the following listed below.

#### Github/BitBucket Account
* Especailly handy if you are a developer making a change into cyber security.
* Showcase your code/scripts/tools anything you have built.
* Aim for atleast semi-regular contribution, you need something to show here.
* Github pages are also an opportunity for free personal blogging.

#### Security Blog
* CTF write ups are the best thing you can put here.
	* You can be a 1337 hacker, but if you can't write a report, you're not very hireable!
* General posts about your opinion on recent vulnerabilities shows that you keep up to date.
	* In security, you need to understand new vulnerabilities quickly so that you can test for them on the job.

#### Personal Website
* Keep it simple.
* You can add a touch of personal flair in the design.
* Great talking point, especially if you have created the site yourself.

#### Optional Accounts

* Bug Crowd - Security bug bounty program. This is for the more advanced security testers, but will get you brownie points if you are collecting bounties.
* Code Academy Account - Show off your initiative and learning.
* Hacker Rank Account - For the more serious programmers. Some organisations use hacker rank as a technical test for new hires.


## Social Media Presence

> *Personal brand: Who are you and why should I care?*

Personal brand is an amalgamation of many elements, that build up over time to tell a story about your experience. Each blog, event, presentation, social media posts - anything that you are known for becomes your brand. You want your personal brand to showcase who you are as a professional and what you can bring to the table. This applies even if you are a student - showcase your value and what would make you a great new hire.

Ideally you want to maximise your personal brand, and minimise content that would damage it.

> *Literally the first step anyone is going to take once they have your name, is find out as much as they can about you online, whether this be potential bosses, or competitors*

Security starts with social media. Public information out on the internet is fair game for anyone wanting to know more about you. Information about you can be put out on the internet in many ways, with friends and family being the most common culprits. Some investigative googling may reveal information avaliable about you that may surprise you. Whatever the case, your goal here is to identify what information is avaliable, and tailor what is avaliable so that it aligns to your objectives.

Whoever is looking to hire you, will google you. I cannot stress this enough. If I discover your public facebook party album, tasteful or not, **you've already made your first impression with me.** 

#### Lockin' It Down

> *When people google my name, what will they see first?  What would I want a potential employer to see? What would they expect to see?*

Privacy settings exist for a reason. Know them, use them. Tailor your profiles to a level you find comfortable. Don't be surprised if you are asked about this in an interview. Your answer is an opportunity to demonstrate your security mind set. You don't have to make everything private, but you need to think about the risks you face and what risks you are comfortable accepting, as this is what clients face on a daily basis.


1. Identify all sources of information leakage about you
	 * List the online accounts you use
	 * What information do you post about yourself?
	 * What information do others post about you?
2. Search for information about yourself
	 * Do this within incognito mode within Chrome or Firefox
	 * Google your name
	 * Pop your name and location into pipl.com
	 * Search for yourself on social media you frequent (without being logged in)
3. Review information gathered
	 * Tailor your visibility/privacy settings to your liking
	 * Close down any old accounts you don't use anymore
4. Done!

#### *Lets get professional... professional*

> They are looking for a professional. Professionals still party (and boy do they), except a professional knows how to keep their work and play seperate online and offline.

##### LinkedIn Profile

This is your platform from which you can launch your personal brand.
In the beginning, I loved LinkedIn, however lately it has taken a bit of a dive. Don't fall into trap of liking memes, or trashy content - keep it relevant. Much of the "motivational" content taken at face value seems relevant, but is often factually incorrect.

**Tips:**

* Only conncet with people you have met in person.
* Keep your profile relevant and up to date.
* Like content that would add to your personal brand.
* Remember that when you post or like content, it adds it to your "recent activity" history.

##### Twitter

This is a security focused twitter, keep it seperate to your personal twitter. Its exceptionally handy for getting the latest news, and getting to know the who's who of cyber internationally.

## Community Involvement

>*Get out there and get networking. Build your network. Get practice talking to people. Learn from others who work in the field.*

The Cyber Security field is growing quickly, but the community is much smaller due to our specialised nature. Obviously this comes with its own advantages, disadvantages and challenges.

**Pros:**

* You can easily meet and chat to those who would be able to hire you on the spot.
* You can easily stand out.
* You'll quickly get to know everyone, and they'll know you too.

**Cons:**

* All of the above, if you make terrible first impressions.

For making a start in the community, Meetup.com is your first port of call. Make an account and see what events are on offer. I've listed my top 3 recommended events to attend. Depending on how much time you have avaliable, you may not be able to all three every month. Pick your favouraite and run with it!

#### SecTalks
> A non-profit session for technical security talks, and hands-on security challenges! A forum to learn & discuss technical (in)security stuff.

I strongly recommend this meetup. With a positive community and a focus on understanding security challenges instead of simply solving them, this is an informative and beginner friendly forum. Talks on offer cater to newbies and more exprienced folk, so once you get the hang of the basics, there are challanges avaliable for you to grow your skills further.

You'll find SecTalks meetups in:

* Perth, Australia
* Sydney, Australia
* Brisbane, Australia
* Melbourne, Australia
* London, UK
* Canberra, Australia
* Adelaide, Australia

#### OWASP Security Meetup
>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a not-for-profit entity, that ensures the project's long-term success. Similar to many open-source software projects it is open to anyone interested in learning more about software security.

OWASP provides you with an opportunity to learn and if you wish, contribute! If you believe you can commit, you'll have an opportunity to contribute to the development of materials. Settle in and see what projects or opportunities are on offer, and they'll work with you to see how you can help.

OWASP has international chapters across the world. In humble Australia, you'll find them in:

* Brisbane
* Canberra
* Melbourne
* Perth
* Sydney

#### Ruxmon

> Established in April 2010, Ruxmon is a free monthly community event organised and run by the Ruxcon team. Currently there are monthly meetings running in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane.

Each month two speakers from the local security community will share their knowledge on a security topic ranging from introductory/beginner level to more advanced topics. Currently meetups are infrequent, so check their events calendar before committing. Presentations are followed up with a catchup at a local pub. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend, especially newcomers.

* Melbourne
* Sydney
* Canberra
* Brisbane

## Industry Awareness

Your job is understanding attack and defence, so you need to study who your attackers are, and start thinking about how you could defend your clients. That is why they hire you after all.

#### Changing Future
Have an opinion on the future of cyber security or technology in general. There are so many changes in this field that impact our daily lives. There is no 'right' answer, but its important to draw your theories from your awareness of IT today.

It is also important to understand the key groups that are shaping and threats and changes of tomorrow. The topics i've listed below are a starting point for the more well known players in cyber security, but it is by no means exhaustive. Do some research and find something that interests you to bring something different to the interview.

#### Threat Actors

Know the key threat actors to all organisations. Generally they fall into 4 major groups:

* **Hacktivists** - *Hacking for the lulz.*
* **Organised Crime** - *Well organised, groups of criminals.*
* **"Lone wolf"** - *Guess what, i'm quitting. Annnnd i'm taking all this Intellectual Property with me.*
* **Nation State** - *It reads like a Tom Clancy novel, except, its legit. (Check out Mandiant's APT1 Espionage Report)*

#### Researchers
As a starting point, check out these researchers and then explore the web to build your network:

* Google's Project Zero Team
* Tavis Ormandy
* @asher_wolf
* @thegrugq
* @SecurityExpert 

#### Conferences

The cyber security conferences on offer range from grassroots movements in the security community, to internationally recognised events.

* Unrestcon (First launched in 2016)
* BSides 
* Kiwicon
* RUXCON
* BlackHat (More business/vendor focused)
* DEFCON home to the "World series of Hacking" this year
	* http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/the-world-series-of-hacking-without-humans/

If you are a student, reach out to the organisers of these conferences. Often you will be able to recieve tickets at a reduced price, or even attend for free!

## Wrapping it up

I'm not going to tell you how to interview, there are thousands of resources on the internet about that already. But hopefully now you have a decent starting point and future direction. There is a lot here in this post, start googling and you'll uncover more cool stuff to help you on your Cyber Security journey.

Good luck!
